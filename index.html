          Ancient lake in Mars’s Gale crater may have actually been a small pond

              A purported ancient lake on Mars may have been far smaller than
              researchers thought. NASA’s Curiosity rover has been exploring
              Gale crater for more than eight years, and while early
              observations suggested the entire crater may once have been filled
              with water, a new analysis implies that it just had a series of
              ponds instead.
            </p>
            <p>
              Previous analyses of data from Curiosity have relied heavily on a
              measure called the chemical index of alteration to determine how
              rocks were weathered over time. Joseph Michalski at the University
              of Hong Kong and his colleagues have suggested that because this
              measure was developed for use on Earth, it may not be valid in the
              extreme Martian climate.
            </p>
            <p>
              Instead, they analysed the concentrations of various compounds
              that are expected to change based on different types of weathering
              over time. They found that some of the layers of rock Curiosity
              examined did interact with water at some point in their past, but
              more are likely to have formed outside of the water.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Over hundreds of metres of strata, it seems that the only layers that are demonstrably lacustrine [formed in a lake] are the lower few metres,” says Michalski. “Of the rocks visited by the rover… the fraction that is demonstrably lacustrine is something like 1 per cent.”
            </p> 
            <p>
              These rocks were mostly in the lowest few metres of sediments in the crater, suggesting the lake was not nearly as deep or extensive as we thought. “There was likely a small lake or more likely a series of small lakes in the floor of Gale crater, but these were shallow ponds,” says Michalski.
            </p>
            <p>
              The rocks that didn’t form in water appeared to be volcanic, so Michalski says that they may have formed out of ash from volcanic eruptions after the water in Gale crater had dried up. Observations by other Mars missions have hinted that these sediments were deposited by wind, not water, so this may solve that mismatch.
